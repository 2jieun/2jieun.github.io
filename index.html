          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Eastern State Penitentiary (hereafter ESP) has had a profoundly dichotomic history throughout its 142-year operation. First conceived as a model for a more humane method of incarceration, the Quaker leaders of Philadelphia wanted to remove the taint of violence and pestilence that ESP’s aging and violent predecessor, the Walnut Street Jail, left on their city. Their grand vision was of a modern penitentiary where the reformative power of faith in God would re-educate these criminals into upstanding Christian members of their society. Yet the practices that many deemed essential to this unorthodox reform methods—a combination of solitary confinement, rudimentary education and religious indoctrination—resulted in what inmates and historians referred to as “dangerous and inhumane” treatment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Thanks to the efforts of the University of Pennsylvania’s Magazine of Early American Datasets (MEAD), we procured data sets of historical records from Eastern State Penitentiary circa 1830 to 1839. As our team was combing through the file, we noticed patterns in the notes for each inmate. These files were compiled by what some believe to be the penitentiary’s first moral instructor, Baptist minister Rev. Thomas Larcombe. In many of these documents, Larcombe and other prison officials jotted numerous negative notations for the inmates’ moral status, such as “deplorable”, “drunken” and “evil” to describe personality traits in the inmates he and his subordinates were attempting to reform. Furthermore, some of these negative descriptions were used to describe prisoners whose lives prior to incarceration were seen as unfit and unholy by those in the upper echelons of Philadelphian society. Of the multiple entries we have reviewed, our team has noticed that many of the more negative entries were reserved for non-whites and immigrants from predominantly Catholic countries, such as Ireland. Much of this has been documented in the Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia, where the Nativist Riots of 1844 was seen as a culmination of anti-Catholic sentiment that plagued the city as early as 1830.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                       Our team intends to find any correlation between Larcombe’s assessment of the inmates and their demographics. Using historical documents and secondary sources, we intend to uncover any correlations in the data between Larcombe’s assessments of the terms “religious”, “Religious and Catholic”, “found redemption” and “not religious” and compare them to demographics such as literacy level and alcohol consumption.  In doing so, we plan to examine this data set for patterns of prejudice, malice and abuse towards certain groups within Eastern State Penitentiary in Larcombe’s assessments. In doing so, we intend to find correlations between the treatment and prejudices of ESP officials, the Prison Society instructors and the rise in anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic sentiment in 1800s Philadelphia.
            We feel this is a significant project, for while much historical focus has been (rightfully) placed on the mistreatment of freed slaves in northern cities during the Antebellum period in the northern states, there has not been as much emphasis placed on the xenophobia and anti-Catholic sentiment that existed during this time. This data can be used to show how certain words were utilized as “code” for acceptable public use to describe certain minority groups. Much how “thug” and “invader” have been used to describe African American and Latino populations among anti-immigrant proponents in public during recent years, we can seek to determine if any of Larcombe’s terminologies were code terms to be used in more professional settings as well. Because language is such a powerful component in these descriptions of prisoners, we strive to utilize the tools available to shed light on otherwise hidden reflections of the societal views of that time.

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Background<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
<p class="lead"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philadelphia was a place of architectural, cultural and societal reform at the turn of the 19thcentury. During the first quarter of the 1800s, Philadelphia witnessed a period of unprecedented growth and influence on the nascent nation. As the port city grew in population to roughly 136,000 inhabitants by 1820, authors, reformists and other dignitaries from around the world would come to witness the improbable successes of the “Philadelphia System” of incarceration.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts were brought forth by the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons, a group of prominent Quakers who looked to alleviate and reform the ills of prison life—ills that many elder Quakers suffered during their persecution while living in Great Britain only decades before. Some of these myriad issues with English imprisonment included the chaining of criminals to floors and walls, “no provisions for feeding prisoners,” lack of heating in winter months and rampant gambling, prostitution, alcohol consumption and violence. Through the outlawing of “public labour,… mutilation, and… whipping” as forms of punishment coupled with attempts to ascribe prisoners religious doctrine and solitary confinement, city leaders and prison wards emphasized the concept of “reform of the prisoner” over capital punishment in their form of criminal penance.
The first tests of the “Pennsylvania System” of criminal reform happened in 1790 at the Walnut Street Jail in central Philadelphia, across the plaza from its revered Independence Hall. While attempts were made by the Prison Society to maintain solitary living conditions for the purpose of these tests, overcrowding and use of the single-occupant cells for “the punishment of those who committed prison infractions” meant the Prison Society needed a new penitentiary capable of holding the influx of tried criminals from the ever-growing population.
Construction of Eastern State Penitentiary began in 1822, with its doors opening in 1829. Almost from the start, guards and other personnel were accused of numerous violations by both the volunteers provided by the Prison Society and by state overseers. Various acts of forced labor and inmate interactions with one another led to the appointment of Reverend Thomas Larcombe to the newly-created position of “Moral Instructor” to the penitentiary. Reverend Larcombe is regarded as the writer of the notes our team is using for our research.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the 1830s, Philadelphia itself witnessed growing discontent and bigotry against its growing immigrant population. During this decade, the number of Catholic churches built in and around the city grew from four in 1830 to thirteen in 1844. The surging population increase and the wave of Irish and German Catholic immigrants emigrating to Philadelphia was seen as a plague on the city by Protestant Philadelphians, as well as opportunistic politicians such as congressman Lewis Levin, who used his virulent stance against immigrants and Catholics as methods to drum up support for his political campaigns. This stoking of tensions led to serious crimes being committed against the populations, with resentment and distrust of the recent immigrants becoming widespread during this time.

  <h2 class="featurette-heading">Data Map<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
<p class="lead"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is also striking is the number of inmates that were born outside the United States (or rather, the lack thereof). Of the 571 inmates on record, twenty-two were born in Europe and only one was born in Africa. The rest seemed to have been born in and around Pennsylvania. This contradicts the narrative of the era, where much of the crime in Philadelphia was blamed on immigrant populations.
  The data provided by MEAD showcases some very interesting trends regarding not just the inmates, but also the penal system which doled out their sentences. For example, Map 1 shows that inmates at Eastern State Penitentiary were not just from Pennsylvania, nor were they primarily from other northeastern countries. In many cases, inmates were transferred to Eastern State Penitentiary from as far south as Bradford County, Florida and as far west as Adams County, Colorado. The records themselves do not show reasons as to why these prisoners were sent to the penitentiary to serve their time. But it is possible that the press and fanfare the prison was receiving for its modern amenities and humane reformative tactics may have led some jailers to send their inmates in hopes of reforming their hardened criminals (or it was merely a way to relieve themselves of that burden).

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Data Visualization</h2>
<h2 class="text-muted">&nbsp;Religion</h2>
<p class="lead"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data found in Larcombe’s notes also provides some considerably important statistics regarding the religious affiliations of the inmates and their dedication to rehabilitation through the Prison Society’s methods. Of the 435 records showing any sense of an inmate’s religious affiliation (Figure 1), 347 were reported as either having “no religion” (205) or “open to learning” about Christianity (142).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who regarded themselves as having no religion or “non-religious”, their experiences and prospects for fair and equal treatment in the penitentiary seem rather bleak. Of the eighty-four prisoners who were not religious, sixty-two of them were deemed “hopeless” and unreceptive to religious instruction by the Prison Society evaluators (Figure 2). By comparison, forty-six of the seventy-one inmates reported as “Open” to new religious instruction were seen as “hopeful” for proper reform. The numbers do not become much better for those who shunned their caretakers; Roughly one in three non-religious inmates considered hopeless died in prison, compared to the eight percent who were open to religion but still deemed hopeless (Figure 5).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the data suggests that non-religious prisoners may have lived the harshest lives in Eastern State Penitentiary, Catholic prisoners often did not have a positive experience, either. While Catholics represented roughly ten percent of the inmate population, none of them were considered “hopeful” for reform (Figures 1 and 3). Furthermore, none were granted early parole (Figure 4). This skewed can be seen as religious bias on the part of both the Prison Society and the Philadelphia penal system, as well as anti-Catholic sentiment that was growing rapidly at the time.
</p>
<br>
<h2 class="text-muted">&nbsp;Literacy</h2>
<p class="lead"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who could read and/or write in the 19thcentury were often considered well-to-do members of society, signifying both monetary wealth and social status. Yet the numbers for Eastern State Penitentiary do not reflect this old adage. Of the 571 records, 337 inmates, or roughly fifty-nine percent could read (Figure 8).
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while this knowledge may have benefitted the inmates who wanted to learn religious doctrine from the Prison Society volunteers, it did not help their chances of early release. According to the data, the average length of an inmate who could read and write was second-highest of the group, at 3.419 years (Figure 7). The group who spent the longest time behind bars? Those who could only spell. Their average sentence length of 5.111 years was nearly two years longer than their fully literate counterparts and nearly double that of those who could not read at all (3.075 years). Were literacy an indicator of status and means, this would show that there was little regard paid to this by authorities in the prison.
</p>
<br>
<h2 class="text-muted">&nbsp;Drinking and Soberiety</h2>
<p class="lead"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prisoner’s drinking level was noted as a likely influence in the judgment of their ability to be reformed. Various categories or distinct levels of drinking were utilized to describe prisoners habits. Other than strictly sober, the records demonstrate that various levels existed. Janofsky informs us that, “In the early 1830s Dr. [Franklin] Bache reported that three-quarters of the inmate population were incarcerated because of alcohol-related crimes” (p. 210).  Fellow physician and temperance advocate, Dr. Daniel Drake, declared that alcohol abuse had the power to physically deteriorate an individual from reasonable health to disease ridden. This made attributing conditions of the prison environment to poor health difficult to distinguish from pre-existing conditions due to alcohol abuse.

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Conclusion<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
<p class="lead"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the data provided and the visualizations our team has produced, we feel confident in  the following conclusions about Eastern State Penitentiary:
  <ul class = "lead">
    <li>Our mapping analysis shows no signs of bias within Pennsylvania’s penal system stemming from the growing xenophobia among nativists in and around Philadelphia during this period. Unfortunately, nothing in our historical research provides an explanation as to why this data does not support the greater narrative of persecution and harassment immigrants received during this time.</li>
<br>
    <li>Our data visualizations suggest inherent bias in the treatment and future prospects of individuals who declared themselves as “non-religious” or as “Catholic”.  While there may have not been any signs of bias regarding the birthplace of these inmates, the data suggests that the developing anti-Catholic sentiment in Philadelphia found its way into the penitentiary, and unfortunately into its reform practices. This is especially troubling when one considers the religious makeup of the Prison Society: Nearly all were practicing Quakers whose ancestors fled Great Britain to the American colonies to avoid persecution and prejudice from the Protestant majority.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Penitentiary physician Dr. Bache stated that three-quarters of the prisoners were at ESP due to crimes committed while under the influence of alcohol.  </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p class="lead">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are confident in our results and analysis, our team believes there are further steps necessary to create a more complete picture of both the effectiveness of the Prison Society’s procedures as well as the pervasiveness of anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant sentiment in the penitentiary’s practices. We believe a more thorough analysis can be achieved by completing the following:
<ul class = "lead">
  <li><b>Incorporating the other volumes: </b>Unfortunately, by the time we found MEAD’s Volume B data set (the second of four volumes kept by the Prison Society), we were nearly done with our research and data cleaning, hence we were unable to utilize this information in our analysis. This volume contains more information about inmates from 1839 to 1843, and could provide further insight as to trends regarding the growth of xenophobic sentiment throughout the city and state (especially since the peak xenophobic event in Philadelphia’s history, the Nativist Riots of 1844, happened shortly after the completion of this volume).
  </li><br>
  <li><b>Incorporating race as criteria for analysis: </b>When we initially proposed our research questions for this assignment, we intended on looking for any information in the data that would suggest any bias toward the different races listed in the data set. However, some of the terminology used to describe these inmates incorporated nationality, gender and religion into the parameters. Others still were variations on established terminology, such as varying degrees of pigmentation among “mulattos”, or mixed-race individuals. Our team determined that in order to present thorough, logical and culturally appropriate analyses, a proper clean-up of this data would require both further research into race relations during this era as well as further support and interpretation by experts in the fields of Sociology and Ethnic Studies. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, completing these measures within our allotted time would not be possible. Yet it is our firm conclusion any further research into these matters should take these factors into consideration.

  </li><br>
      <li><b>Figuring out the actual writer (or writers) of these volumes:</b>These volumes contain a substantial amount of information on the inmates of Eastern State Penitentiary, but they do not provide accounts for who actually wrote these documents. Our team endured significant debates on how to present the author(s) of the original document and the subsequent data set. Many of us believed Reverend Larcombe to be the sole writer of these documents. However, we soon realized this might not be possible, as he was not hired by the Prison Society to oversee moral instruction at the penitentiary until 1838, some eight years after the volume’s first entry. Though it may be possible Larcombe was part of the early volunteer envoy who conducted the interviews, there is no evidence of his services being rendered in both the data set and in our historical research. Further investigation into the lives of those responsible for this bevy of information—names, social status, education and profession—could possibly provide further insight into the Society’s processes and the reasoning for their decisions pertaining to these inmates.
      </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2 class="featurette-heading">About<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
<h2 class="text-muted">&nbsp;Sources</h2>
<p class="lead"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our data stems from prison inmate records collected and preserved by the American Philosophical Society Library. The library’s records contain information on every prisoner between 1830 and 1892, including name, age, ethnicity, offense and sentencing length. What is most interesting about these records is the personal information collected about nearly each inmate. These detailed notes, credited to Reverend Larcombe, give descriptions of interactions between he, his fellow volunteers from the Prison Society, and the inmates. Nearly all of these entries describe the volunteers’ efforts to provide religious education, while also providing some with rudimentary education in writing and other skills. It is these notes where our team intends to draw most of the information for our purposes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two books from these records were transcribed and digitized by Scott Ziegler and Michelle Ziogas for the Magazine of Early American Datasets, which publishes through the University of Pennsylvania. For our analysis, we referred to MEAD’s data set for volume A, which provided information on inmates admitted from 1830-1839. While there was a data set that pertained to inmates from 1839-1843 (volume B), we unfortunately found the file weeks into our project, and were unable to clean up the data with enough time to complete the processes we used on volume A.
</p><br>

<h2 class="text-muted">&nbsp;Processing and Presentation</h2>
<p class="lead"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MEAD’s data set was cleaned up manually by half of our team. This was done in order to guarantee accuracy by not using macros in Excel in order to make corrections on large scales that could potentially cause errors in our visualizations that could have potentially skewed our results. We used Breve tools to find the inaccuracies and possible errors in the data set. Programs such as Stanford University’s Palladio and Tableau Public were utilized for our data visualizations.
