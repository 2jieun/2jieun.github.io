      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our group project, our team chose the Eastern State Penitentiary Admission Book A, provided by the University of Pennsylvania’s Magazine of Early American Datasets (henceforth referred to as “MEAD”). This data set tells us about the inmates admitted to Eastern State Penitentiary from 24 April, 1830 to 27 July, 1839. Within this data set, we have access to each inmates’ name, age, the type of crimes they committed as well as their subsequent sentences. Demographic information also contains occupation, race/ethnicity, and birthplace. Personal skill levels of reading and writing proficiency are noted consistently. The ethnicity, religion and occupation field is where being female is noted.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most fascinating about the data set is the information collected regarding each prisoner’s mental health and demeanor while incarcerated at the penitentiary. The original source material—a collection of admission records amassed by the prison’s first moral instructor, Baptist minister Thomas Larcombe—provides detailed descriptions of his interactions and assessments of many of these inmates during their incarceration and upon their release.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larcombe’s insightful records provide a plethora of data our team can utilize to assess various legal and sociological trends of the 1830s. Historically speaking, Eastern State Penitentiary was seen as a model for penal systems of that time, which looked to reform inmates instead of merely providing swift and brutal punishment for their crimes. Its methods of solitary confinement, inability for inmates to communicate with one another, and the limited access to outdoor activities was seen as a more humane approach to the typical penal systems of other states and municipalities of the era. Furthermore, the severity of punishment in standard jails and prisons was to have decreased significantly for lesser, non-violent offenses such as forgery, prostitution and petty larceny under the sympathetic Quaker-based laws being introduced in Pennsylvania during the 1830s. Larcombe’s records and MEAD’s data set does give insight in both the crime committed and the sentence received for a large portion of the inmates. Should time permit, it is possible to compare these prisoners’ sentences to other municipalities in the United States for comparison. The system utilized at the Auburn Correctional Facility in New York may be suitable for that purpose.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are  also opportunities to compare sentences between different races and ethnicities. Also occurring during this period were waves of non-Protestant immigrants arriving from countries such as Ireland, Germany and Italy for employment and opportunity in the burgeoning industrial American economy. These immigrants, along with former African and African American slaves in Pennsylvania, were historically treated as second-class residents by police. Utilizing MEAD’s data set, we can analyze whether crimes and punishment varied between white Pennsylvanians and people of color, naturalized citizens and immigrants, and/or practitioners of Protestant Christianity and Catholicism. We can also examine if other factors, such as employment, occupation, education, age, birthplace or arresting location played any factor in the inmates’ sentences and rehabilitation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are, however, numerous points of data that are missing from Larcombe’s records and thus missing from MEAD’s data set. Most notably, there are no records of recidivism for the inmates who completed their sentence, nor are there any records of their existence and livelihoods post-incarceration in this set. This means we are unable to gather any relevant data as to the success of Pennsylvania’s unorthodox (for their time) methods of inmate rehabilitation solely from the data presented. Much like comparing the average sentence duration for Eastern State Penitentiary to those of other parts of the country at that time, further research and data collection would need to be conducted in order to garner any true understanding of the effectiveness of Eastern State Penitentiary’s attempts at rehabilitation. Moreover, there were also missing data regarding ethnicity which was oddly categorized in combination with one’s occupation and religion. This brings to question about whether the attribute was purposely combined due to society’s definition of ethnicity at the time or is it simply a choice to combine them during the process of extracting the data. Regardless, this makes it more complicated to analyze the role of ethnicity in conjunction with sentencing and comments made by correctional officers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unfortunately, Larcombe’s record-keeping does lend itself to some personal analysis of his inmates’ dispositions, which understandably revolve around his theological training and pastoring of numerous Baptist churches prior to his public service. In a number of comments, Larcombe refers to his inmates as “thoughtless”, “unconcerned”, “deranged” and “hopeless”. And while much of this information is helpful in humanizing the names and inmate numbers listed in the data set, it does nothing to show whether Eastern State Penitentiary's attempts to rehabilitate its inmates into productive members of society were successful. Perhaps with other data on each inmates’ lives after incarceration, we could perform a proper analysis and provide evidence supporting or negating the claims being made by those proponents of Pennsylvania’s penal system at the time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lastly, the fact that this data set only covers one of Larcombe’s three volumes limits how detailed our findings can be. According to the State Penitentiary for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Records website, who are the holders of Larcombe’s original records, these records span between 1830 and 1892, and presumably would provide more data for analysis in the potential trends aforementioned, such as potential racial and ethnic bias.
While the data set provided by the University of Pennsylvania’s MEAD program is limited in scope and contains notes that could skew some analysis based on minister Larcombe’s inherent biases, it still is a helpful resource for us to research and present our findings over. Our team believes that this file ultimately contains a plethora of data points that can be used to garner a better understanding of both the occupants of this radically experimental prison and the penal system which placed them within its gothic-styled walls.
