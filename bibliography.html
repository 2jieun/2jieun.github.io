              <p>The author emphasizes what would decrease crime and reform the criminal. The governor led them to have virtuous habits and deviate from the life-long indolent. The enlightened educators were needed for prisoners because knowledge is required in order to overpower their passion, realizing distinctions between right and wrong, and win free from the prejudice that prisoners got. She certainly believed that prisoners need to gain knowledge and experience of human nature to produce an awakening and encouraging effect upon the prisoners. When she visited the Eastern State Penitentiary, after a careful review if the Penitentiary, she had her conviction that their discipline was very safe and effective mode of prison management. Also, she believed that solitary imprisonment is helpful to follow Eastern Penitentiary moral and religious instruction. This source highlights and gives evidence that the prisoners in the Eastern State Penitentiary learned how to read and write during their prison life because governors and officers thought obtaining knowledge is significant to reform the criminal.

              <p>The reformers and officials in the Eastern State Penitentiary implemented disciplinary regimens because they thought regimens would transform prisoners into productive citizens. During the prisoners’ confinement, they were forced to labor to acquire the benefits of the state. Additionally, the Eastern Penitentiary provided essential reading, writing, and religious instruction. The reformers implemented regimens to teach the characteristics of an ideal American citizen and allow incarcerated men and women to make habits. The reformers intended the regiments to inculcate sobriety, discipline, industry, and teach them proper gender roles even if the prisoners resisted to learn. A number of prisoners wanted to maintain own pre-incarceration customs and identities. This resource argues that the Eastern State Penitentiary implemented disciplinary regimens to help them become an ideal citizen. It underlines that the penitentiary provided religious instruction and the materials to read and write, thus, the prisoners obtain more knowledge. This resource provides more information about how there were able be educated as description on our data says.

            <p>Vaux and his council published their findings on the history and progress of Eastern State Penitentiary and presented their findings to prison reformers in London in 1872. In it, they discuss the positives of ESP’s solitary confinement system. Since most, if not all, the information presented comes from first-hand accounts of inspectors and other prison officials of that era, it provides context and perspective from that era that would otherwise be difficult to obtain in individual posts. Furthermore, it is possible these notes and observations can provide supplementary information as to treatment of the prisoners themselves, and aid us in interpreting Larcombe’s prisoner notes.

          <p>This document presented five years after the opening of ESP and published the following year document a committee hearing with the state legislature about reports of prisoner abuse, deviant acts (such as sexual intercourse and rape) and embezzlement by the warden and other guards. Much of this information was gathered in investigations and interviews with staff, prisoners and outside workers and done to dismiss or corroborate evidence collected over the first five years. This document is especially valuable in conducting research about ESP and the in-place practices that plagued its attempts at reforming prisoners. It also provides concrete primary evidence of any kinds of malfeasance occurring during the time our data was collected.

          <p>Johnston’s book discusses much of the history behind the creation of ESP, from the roots of its reform through isolation methods to the first experiments with isolation incarceration at the Cherry Hill jail in Philadelphia. This information can prove beneficial in understanding both how ESP came to be and also where the experiment went wrong.

      <li>Kahan, Paul. 2012. Seminary of Virtue: The Ideology and Practice of Inmate Reform at Eastern State Penitentiary, 1829-1971. New York: Lang<br>
          <p>Paul Kahan argues that the 1829-1970 Eastern State Penitentiary primarily focused on reforming inmates by using an extensive and aggressive educational program influenced by religion. Kahan uses peer-reviewed articles from 22 primary and 82 secondary sources. The Seminary of virtue...Inmate Reform at Eastern State Penitentiary, 1829-1971 is important because it provides the reader a carefully annotated timeline of the prison’s philosophy and its developers. The first two chapters heavily focus on the history of the groups involved in implementing the reform system, why they were involved, and the structure they left in place. Kahan’s insights are important for our thesis because it allows us to compare the data to the 1830-70 religious and educational system of the time. Therefore, our data should depict lower sentences and shorter sentences served for the inmates who reflected the values of the time.

          <p>Jacqueline Thibaut argues that early prison reformers attempted to reduce recidivism by creating resentment in the prisoners and increasing moral reclamation. Thibaut states that the system attempted to maintain a good reputation for the reform system, and that the committee who oversaw the prison was ran by members of the groups who created its structure. Thibaut uses primary and secondary peer-reviewed sources. The resource is important because it highlights the categories each prisoner was given in their case description from the dataset. Thibaut argues that there is a lack of transparency by the notetakers and guards, and that the prison was less effective than it claimed to be. This resource is important to our thesis because it brings forth questions about the consistency of the data we are observing. We have to ask whether the notes taken by the guards were true in nature or simply a subjective observation of the inmate through the eyes of a religious and biased notetaker.

          <p>Martinson writes about how education affects to prisoners, and what results came out from the education. There were many different ways to educate prisoners to reduce second conviction and to reform them as a member of society. For example, some prisoners got the education to get a job outside of the prison, but this education was not effective. The prisoners who got psychological education made better results than the other prisoners who did not get the psychological education. Many scholars wanted to find a way to reform the prisoners. The one education which had more good results than other education was group-therapy. It reformed many prisoners. Martinson introduces the various ways to reform prisoners and the process of the development of the educations.

          <p>Schwartz mostly writes about Tocqueville and Beaumont's study of the penitentiary. Tocqueville and Beaumont researched and tested many theories. In this article, Schwartz says, there was a test about solitary confinement. This test was related to religion, but it is also related to the social problem. The prisoner could not meet anyone and they were in the independent cell. They also had limitation to get a job. The result of this test failed. Since the prisoner could not have a social relationship, they could not be reformed and resocialized. Through this test based on the theory, prisoner also needs to have a relationship.

He first did not accept the situation, but finally, he accepted his status to stay prison for a long time. There were various program to reform the prisoners like job educations. He chose psychological therapy and effective speech. Through the psychological therapy, he got the program of group-therapy, and it helped him to think a different way. He became different through the education. He could think about his crime and regret what he did. Vonderheide expresses how the education helped prisoners through the diary.

Philadelphia<br>
          <p>This book argues about the significance of training for prison officers and describes religious instruction and education in the prison. The book also reveals the perspective from warden Cassidy that the majority of prisoners’ who are abstainers (don’t drink) tend to be those who commit crimes against property rather than persons. The warden of Eastern penitentiary argues that those who intend to commit crimes do so independent of their drinking habits. The source uses speeches and interviews from the warden of Eastern State Penitentiary. This source will be useful in providing information about the insight of the warden of Eastern Penitentiary. It will also provide contradiction towards our initial assumption that prisoner’s are generally drinkers who commit these crimes under intoxication.

      " target ="_blank">The Torture of Solitary.</a>, Wilson Quarterly <br>
          <p>This article argues that the Eastern State Penitentiary had failed its goal of reformation as  solitary confinement is a costly form of torture that led to insanity. It demonstrates that “Eastern State Penitentiary was widely considered a failure, but that didn't stop other prisons from implementing its "separate system"with equally disastrous results” (Griest). The author uses Charles Dicken’s travelogue American Notes where he wrote about his experience there visiting inmates in 1842 and the prison’s annual reports. The source also provides experiences from inmates Joe Loya and Robert Hillary King. Moreover, the author also pulls from her own experience on a visit to the modern day visitors’ center to describe the prison. This source is important because provides us with real experiences of prisoners during the time the prison was in use. It also shows us the statistics of how unsuccessful solitary confinement was. As for how this affects our these, this source shows that the intent for reformation was generally considered a failure which contradicts our examination of how prisoner’s gaining literacy through imprisonment may have led to reformation.

      The authors provide background and history on the era’s preference of reform over punishment. This book emphasizes specifically Eastern State Penitentiary as a model focused on concern for the well-being of those incarcerated. Various illustrations are included of the prison’s architectural design, which is a component of revolutionizing the corrections system. Because the physical aspects of the penitentiary are interwoven in the rehabilitation methods and possible outcomes, this material may help support or refute possible findings arrived at in our dataset.

          <p>Mintz argues that multicausal approaches influenced reform efforts; he focuses on the significance of politics as well as interactions between reformers and those who were the intended recipients of their efforts. Mintz states that there were a variety of motives for reform efforts and that the backgrounds of those supporting the effort were diverse. Mintz provides a look into cultural components in effect during the antebellum period. By utilizing the context that Mintz offers, we can gain insight about the dataset of the prison population of Eastern State Penitentiary.
